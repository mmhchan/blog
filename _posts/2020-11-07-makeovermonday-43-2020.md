# Apparel exports to the US

## The original data visualisation

The original data visualisation does a good job of showing the monthly evolution of exports for each year, and how the data from 2019 compares to 2020.

However, the y-axis between countries have different scales, which can mislead readers about the magnitude of the deficit. For example, the total lost value of India is far greater than El Salvador, but the latter occupies a greater area.

## My makeover

As the original report was about year-over-year differences, I decided to focus my makeover on this specifically. The dashboard can present the difference either in dollars or as a percentage.

I made the y-axis between each country consistent, to make it easier to compare countries than in the original.

In hindsight, removing the M for million from the data labels, and mentioning the scale in the subtitle would make the numbers more readable.

## What I could improve upon

### Data visualisation
- Writing better titles and subtitles.
- Including a paragraph to explain the context and/or insight around the topic.
- Having a clear idea of the dashboard dimensions before working on it.
- Creating my own visual styles.

### Mindset
- Overcome perfectionist tendencies.
- Avoid judging my work relative to that of others.
- Trust in the benefits of long term practice.
- Get comfortable with seeking feedback.

I plan to incorporate the Viz Review Webinars into my routine, as I think it would be encouraging to see peers who are also improving their skills.

Getting accustomed to the Makeover Monday process will take some time, but the only way to overcome this is to repeat this process.
