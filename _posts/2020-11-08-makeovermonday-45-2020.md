# Dedicated video game sales units

## The original data visualisation

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/makeovermonday/2020_W45_original.jpg "Original data visualisation")

## What works

### Easy to compare annual hardware sales of regions combined

By comparing the height of the stacked bars, it's simple to see that hardware sales have increased with each passing year.

## What doesn't work

### No data for 2016

Without any data for 2016, there is unused space on the left side which can be reclaimed.

The reason that there isn't any data is related to the fact that *the Nintendo Switch wasn't released until March 3, 2017*.

### What the dates represent is unclear

It's unclear what the dates along the x-axis represent.

Is the visualisation comparing units sold between:
- March of each year?
- The end of Q1 of each year?
- Fiscal years, beginning or ending in March?

### Appears to be under performance in 3/2017

The visualisation seems to show that the Nintendo Switch underperformed in 3/2017, and no explanation is given.

However, If we combine the fact that 1) the platform launched on March 3, 2017, and 2) from the source website, we discover that Nintendo's fiscal year ends in March, then a reasonable conclusion is that the dates do represent the end of fiscal years. 3/2017 has only 1 month of sales, whereas the subsequent data points contain an whole fiscal year's worth — it is technically not an underperformance.

### Hardware and software units in the same chart

Hardware and software units not are comparable (unlike revenue), so there's little reason to combine them into the same chart using dual axes.

The axes are not even the same magnitudes.

It's also easy for the lines to be mistake as trend lines for the bars.

### Difficult to tell if the lines are stacked

While it's clear the the bars are stacked, allowing the reader to compare annual totals, it's unclear if the same is true for the lines.

It is only by comparing the visualisation with the table that we can be certain that the lines are not stacked. Mixing some stacked marks with non-stacked marks in the same visualisation causes confusion.

### Inconsistent region colours

Both the hardware and software data are split by region:
- Japan
- The Americas
- Europe
- Other

However, the colour coding of regions are inconsistent, which makes it difficult to recognise them when they appear in multiple places.

## My makeover

I decided split the chart in two — hardware and software — which the reader can switch between using a filter. They can also view one region at a time by highlighting the region they are interested in on the right.

An annotation was also included to explain why the first year has a smaller magnitude than the subsequent years.
